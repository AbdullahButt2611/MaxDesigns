## Introduction

<p align = "justify">
This is a full-stack web based application project for the company called <b>Max Design</b> for handling the projects and dealing with the clients and also handling the employee's data all saved into the single application. The basic overview of this project is that the project is efficient, easy-to-use and responsive to the queries of the user. The basic need of this project was for the company as projects produce a huge amount of data and this can't be tackled in papers only. So, to provide the ease, the user's were granted with the solution of saving all the data in soft form and then retrieving it on the basis of the requirement when needed in hard template. The basic requirement that the system fulfills is that the user can efficiently access their data stored into the system and then make amendments accordingly. The decision making is also handled in the system as the projects status automatically changes. The data seurity and authorization was the main focus while dealing with the user separations. <br>

A vending functionality has been introduced into the system, which allows the user to make direct links with the vendor's items and decide themselves that which item or items would be perfect for their house. This also invokes the mechanism of decision making. The vendor will have th ecomplete authority to the company and can make deals accordingly providing a linient hand on changing the system. However, a check will be kept by the admin. Also, the employee's stats are also maintained and based on them, the raise in the salary are handled. <br>

Talking about the keypoint, then when we talk about the construction company, the first thing that comes in our mind id the project of construction, so, it's data should be maintained in the system and should be reliable. This functionality is also handled by the system quite efficiently. Not only the project detail, but also the payment receipts and order details are kept in storage and are rendered as the final report by the system.
